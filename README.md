# My Top 10 Movies Website

A beautiful website that lists our top 10 films of all time using Flask/WTForms/SQLite/SQLAlchemy and more. As we watch more movies, we can always update our list and keep track of which movies to recommend people.


## Concepts Practiced
- SQLite Databases
- SQLAlchemy
- CRUD Operations with SQLAlchemy
- Build a SQLite Database into the Flask Website
- CSS & HTML

## Languages Implemented
- HTML
- CSS
- Python (Flask and WTForms)

## Progression
At the moment the front of the movie card says None in large letters.
Instead, we want it to display the ranking of the movie according to our rating. e.g.

<img width="430" alt="2020-10-06_16-18-23-ab58b26a47bfdef41de714f99c46a888" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78344685/174010782-a1cc308b-242d-49b1-a736-a5042076dcab.png">


If we gave The Matrix a rating of 9.2 and Spirited Away was rated 9.5 and those are the only 2 movies we've added then it should display:

If we add another movie and it had the highest rating among the movies, then it should be ranked according to it's rating.
e.g. If Matrix (9.3), Spirited Away (9.5), Parasite (9.9)

But if we edit the rating so that it becomes: Matrix (9.3), Spirited Away (9.5), Parasite (8.9), then this is what should happen:
